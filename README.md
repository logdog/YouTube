# About Me
Hi everyone! My name is Logan, and I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University. I love teaching, so in my spare time, I like to put together videos that I wish existed when I was an undergraduate student! I hope these videos inspire you to try and simulate your own mechanical sysetms, and learn some fun mathematics!

## YouTube Channel
[Logan Dihel on YouTube.](https://youtube.com/@logandihel) Learn engineering, math, and computer science from a graduate student and (former) NASA engineer! My goal is to teach $10^6$ people something new with short, digestible content. I try to target more advanced topics that are not covered well on YouTube.

## Lagrangian Mechanics
Lagrangian mechanics is a beautiful way to model a mechanical system using energy. I have a series of videos teaching you how to use Lagrangian mechanics for a variety of systems. All of the code for these videos are compiled in this repo. More to come!

## Commonly Asked Questions
_Why do you use Python and not MATLAB in your videos?_

I believe that anyone who wants to learn engineering should be able to with free, publically available software. While MATLAB is a wonderful tool, but it is prohibitively expensive if you don't have access through an institution. Python is the world's most popular programming language, and it's free!

_How did you learn all this stuff?_

I learned Lagrangian mechanics from watching YouTube videos and reading free online lecture notes. I started with common systems (pendulum, spring mass) so that I could compare answers against online answers. When learning something new, I always start small.

_What is the best way to get started programming?_

The best way to learn anything is do jump into it and create. You don't need to spend hours and hours watching tutorials online. All you need is an understanding of variables and simple functions to do most tasks.

Pick a small project that excites you: the simpler, the better. For graphics, use print statements in your terminal. Print out a Christmas tree using \* characters in your terminal, or make a simple hangman game. With every project you complete, your confidence and ability to read documentation will grow. I particularly like making games, as they are really fun to make and will test your abilities as a programmer.
